# Project Andre Moura Passos

This project contains the application for the **Andre Moura Passos** personal website, integrating a robust backend with a modern React frontend. The project leverages a range of technologies to deliver a comprehensive web experience and serves as a digital portfolio showcasing creative works, audio compositions, and personal projects.

## Overview

The application is divided into two main parts:
- **Backend**: Handles API requests, data management, email processing, and playlist control. It also serves a collection of audio files organized by category.
- **Frontend**: Built with React, it delivers an interactive and responsive user interface with support for multiple languages. The site features dynamic visual elements, a media player for curated audio content, and sections dedicated to showcasing personal projects and creative expression.
